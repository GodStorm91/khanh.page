## Preface
Today I have been working with AWS and some serious trouble has been occured since 2019.08.24.
The AWS Data center has been outage for around 8 hours which brought all the servers in `ap-northeast-1` region down
(some what they referred as the temperature failure has been the main problem to this incident). 
And one of our servers has died forever (due to the underlying EBS has been in trouble and couldn't be restored)

## Workaround
Wow, trouble happened and we don't have any backup for that EBS (holy...)
